  - title: What is the difference between boosting and bagging?
    answers:
      - label: Bagging sequentially improves the model sequentially by focusing on the observations that were not well predicted by the model previously while boosting trains the model on random samples from the original data
      - label: Boosting sequentially improves the model sequentially by focusing on the observations that were not well predicted by the model previously while bagging trains the model on random samples from the original data
        correct: true
      - label: They are two ensemble methods, bagging can be seen as a resampling method that will specifically focus on the weaknesses of the model, while boosting focuses at random on different groups of observations
      - label: There's no difference!
  - title: Why do we split the data between a train and a test set?
    answers:
      - label: The train set helps us train the model and the test set lets us evaluate the model as if it was used on previously unseen data, thus giving a trustworthy estimate of the model's performance
        correct: true
      - label: Many different models may be trained on the train set, the model that achieves the best train score is then evaluated on the test set to calculate is generalization power
      - label: The model is trained on both the test set and the train set and the two performance scores obtain give us the performance range we can expect from the model on unseen data
      - label: This technique is useful to compare models and find out the best hyperparemeters for each model
  - title: Why do we use cross validation in combination with grid search to find out the best hyper parameters for a given model?
    answers:
      - label: Cross validation helps the grid search run faster
      - label: Cross validation gives us a more accurate measure of the generalization performance of each version of the model
        correct: true
      - label: It is impossible to run grid search without cross validation
      - label: You should never ever use cross validation with grid search as it may cause a leak that would corrupt all our performance scores
  - title: What's a stationary time series?
    answers:
      - label: A time series with no trend
      - label: A time series with a constant trend
