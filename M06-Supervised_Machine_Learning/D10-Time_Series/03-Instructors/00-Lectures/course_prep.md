# Course Preparation

This lecture focuses on timeseries modelling and forecasting.

## Lecture - Time series - 60 min

This lecture is an introduction to time series modelling and forecasting. Some of the students may not be familiar with this field, so you'll have to take some time to explain why it's different from what they have seen before, and why "classical" models will fail. Feel free to cite some concrete examples of applications of time series modelling/forecasting.

## Lecture - Time series with Prophet - 80 min

This lecture is a code template showing how to use Facebook's Prophet to make some forecasting.

If you get some troubles while trying to install fbprophet on JULIE, just switch to Google Colab. It will also be a good opportunity to show Colab to the students, as they will work a lot on this platform during the Deep Learning lectures.

## Exercise - Prophet Exercise - 120 min

This exercise is a direct application of what the students learnt about fbprophet. There is no major difficulty, but the exercise is a bit long. If the students don't make it to the end in less than two hours, you can finish the exercise in livecoding.

## Quizz - 30 min

Save at least 30 minutes in the end of the afternoon such that the students can take the module's quizz and you can make a correction.

## Project - Time series

For the end of the afternoon, the students can use fbprophet to tackle the time series project. This project is just about making some forecasting on stock prices, so it shouldn't take more than 2-3 hours of work.
