# Machine Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and understanding of Machine Learning, divided into two primary sections: Supervised Machine Learning and Unsupervised Machine Learning. Each section contains a set of exercises, projects, and instructor materials designed to enhance learning and practical application of machine learning concepts.

## Sections

### 1. Supervised Machine Learning

In this section, we delve into the fundamentals and advanced topics of Supervised Machine Learning, exploring various algorithms and their applications. It is structured as follows:

- **00-Lectures**: The notebooks for the course part.
- **01-Exercises**: Practical exercises to apply supervised learning concepts.
- **02-Project**: A comprehensive project that applies supervised learning techniques to solve a real-world problem.
- **03-Instructors**: Materials and notes for instructors to facilitate teaching and understanding of complex concepts.

### 2. Unsupervised Machine Learning

This section focuses on Unsupervised Machine Learning, exploring how to uncover hidden patterns and correlations in data without predefined labels. It includes:

- **00-Lectures**: The notebooks for the course part.
- **01-Exercises**: Exercises designed to provide hands-on experience with unsupervised learning algorithms.
- **02-Project**: A project section where unsupervised learning methods are applied to unearth insights from datasets.
- **03-Instructors**: Instructor resources including lecture notes and guidance for explain
